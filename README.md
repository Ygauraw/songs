Command line tool to download songs with.

This is a proof-of-concept tool that was made to see if we can work with various media websites to download
media files from without user intervention. The only user input that is needed is the title of the movie the
song belongs to.

The sole aim of this tool is to learn how to work with various out-of-browser HTML parsing techniques and 
automating the various workflows, and how each page and finding information from the same can be so different.
